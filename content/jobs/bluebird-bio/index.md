During my tenure at bluebird bio, I developed processes for a suite of CAR-T cell therapies, including the FDA-approved **Ide-cel (Abecma)**, a pre-clinical allogeneic gamma-delta CAR-T product, and a pre-clinical dual CD79a/CD20 targeting CAR-T product. My work focused on designing closed, automated manufacturing processes and characterizing cell drug product attributes through high-dimensional flow cytometry. Recognizing the complexity of these biological systems, I championed the adoption of statistical Design of Experiments (DoE) and multivariate modeling, shifting the team's approach from intuition-based to data-driven process development.
