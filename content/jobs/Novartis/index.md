At Novartis, I'm driving the development and commercialization of **T-Charge**—a next-generation, rapid CAR-T manufacturing platform. I combine advanced data science with deep CMC domain expertise to enhance decision-making and accelerate clinical development.

I've built analytics infrastructure that lets our global teams see around corners. From **automated ETL pipelines**, **interactive dashboards**, **NLP-driven root cause analysis**, **predictive machine learning**, to **Bayesian models** that simulate manufacturing success before we run a single batch—my work spans the full spectrum from data engineering to visualization to advanced statistical modeling.

The common thread is turning complex, messy biological and manufacturing data into clear, actionable insights that directly influence **process design**, **real-time manufacturing decisions**, **regulatory filings**, and **clinical trial design**.
