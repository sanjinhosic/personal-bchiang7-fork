At Nantero, I worked on cutting-edge nanotechnology for next-generation semiconductor memory. The company was developing **NRAM**—a high-density, high-speed nonvolatile RAM using carbon nanotubes. My role focused on developing and optimizing the manufacturing process for a high CMOS-grade purity liquid formulation of carbon nanotubes, which was spin-coated onto silicon wafers to enable the memory switches at the heart of NRAM technology.
