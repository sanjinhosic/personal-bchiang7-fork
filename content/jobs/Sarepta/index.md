Scientist in the Manufacturing Science & Technology (MS&T) department supporting upstream (solid phase synthesis) and downstream (ultrafiltration/diafiltration, chromatography) GMP manufacturing of commercial RNA drug product **Exondys 51** and clinical pipeline. Developed and implemented a **logistic regression model in R** to automate the classification of analytical HPLC peaks from collection fractions of the GMP chromatography process—labeling over 2,500 chemical compounds per manufacturing run. This replaced a high-error, manual process performed by 3 FTEs, significantly improving both speed and accuracy.
