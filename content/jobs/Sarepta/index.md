At Sarepta, I worked in the Manufacturing Science & Technology (MS&T) department, supporting both upstream solid phase synthesis and downstream purification (ultrafiltration, chromatography) for the commercial RNA drug product **Exondys 51** and clinical pipeline. While there, I spotted an opportunity to eliminate a tedious, error-prone manual process: classifying thousands of HPLC peaks from chromatography fractions. I built a **logistic regression model in R** that automated this classification—labeling over 2,500 chemical compounds per manufacturing run and replacing work previously done by 3 FTEs with significantly higher speed and accuracy.
